Official Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs). As you modify your source, `systemjs-hot-reloader` will add, remove, or swap out modules in the running application, without a page refresh (significantly speeding up development time).

`systemjs-hot-reloader` **MUST** be used in conjunction with event source such as:
- [systemjs-tools](https://github.com/alexisvincent/systemjs-tools) - smart development server
- [chokidar-socket-emitter](https://github.com/capaj/chokidar-socket-emitter) - simple file watcher
- [jspm-dev-buddy](https://atom.io/packages/jspm-dev-buddy) - atom plugin

`systemjs-hot-reloader` is a thin layer on top of [systemjs-hmr](https://github.com/alexisvincent/systemjs-hmr), which provides the meat of the reloading logic. If you are a library author looking to integrate HMR into your library or want a better understanding of how HMR works in [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) then check it out.

## Usage
Install with your client-side package manager (choose one)
- `jspm install --dev npm:systemjs-hot-reloader`
- `yarn add --dev systemjs-hot-reloader`
- `npm install --save-dev systemjs-hot-reloader`

`systemjs-hot-reloader` **MUST** run before your application code otherwise SystemJS
won't know how to resolve your app's `@hot` imports.

Assuming your app entry point is `app.js`, wrap your import statement so that you first load `systemjs-hot-reloader`.

```html
<script>
    System.import('systemjs-hot-reloader').then((connect) => {
        connect()
        System.import('app.js')
    })
</script>
```

`connect` can be passed a number of custom options. To initialise a custom connection

```html
<script>
    System.import('systemjs-hot-reloader').then((connect) => {
        connect({ host: '//localhost:1234' })
        System.import('app.js')
    })
</script>
```

Until SystemJS does automatically, you need to tell SystemJS how to handle
the `@hot` imports when building your app. To do this, add the following to
your jspm config file.

```js
{
  ...
  "map": {
    ...
    "@hot": "@empty"
  }
}
```

`systemjs-hot-reloader` will automatically set `SystemJS.trace = true`, so you no longer
need to set this manually, as with previous versions.

### Production
In production, `systemjs-hot-reloader` maps to an empty module so you can leave
the `systemjs-hot-reloader` import in your `index.html`.

### State Hydration and Safe Module Unloads
As described [here](https://github.com/alexisvincent/systemjs-hmr#state-hydration-and-safe-module-unloads), state hydration is handled in the following way.

When hot module replacement is added to an application there are a few modifications we may need to
make to our code base, since the assumption that your code will run exactly once has been broken.

When a new version of a module is imported it might very well want to reinitialize it's own state based
on the state of the previous module instance, to deal with this case and to cleanly unload your module
from the registry you can import the previous instance of your module as you would any other module,
as well as export an `__unload` function that will be called upon `System.unload`, ie. when your module is reloaded.

```javascript
/**
 * You can import the previous instance of your module as you would any other module.
 * On first load, module == false.
 */
import { module } from '@hot'

/**
 * Since all exports of the previous instance are available, you can simply export any state you might want to persist.
 *
 * Here we set and export the state of the file. If 'module == false' (first load),
 * then initialise the state to {}, otherwise set the state to the previously exported
 * state.
 */
export const _state = module ? module._state : {}

/**
 * If you're module needs to run some 'cleanup' code before being unloaded from the system, it can do so,
 * by exporting an `__unload` function that will be run just before the module is deleted from the registry,
 * ie. as your module is being unloaded in preparation for being reloaded.
 *
 * Here you would unsubscribe from listeners, or any other task that might cause issues in your application,
 * or prevent the module from being garbage collected.
 *
 * See SystemJS.unload API for more information.
 */
export const __unload = () => {
    console.log('Unload something (unsubscribe from listeners, disconnect from socket, etc...)')
    // force unload React components
    ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(DOMNode);	// your container node
}
```

## React
### This section isn't yet finished. see https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/tree/next/docs for full instructions
If you also want the added benefit of your react component state persisting across
reloads, you can use [Dan Abramov's](https://github.com/gaearon) excellent [react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) project, in conjunction with this one.

`react-hot-loader` functions as a babel transform for your react apps, so we need to add it as a babel plugin.

Install with your client-side package manager (choose one)
- `jspm install --dev npm:react-hot-loader`
- `yarn add --dev react-hot-loader`
- `npm install --save-dev react-hot-loader`

## Contributing
I've tried to keep both this, and [systemjs-hmr](https://github.com/alexisvincent/systemjs-hmr) as beginner friendly as possible with lots of comments. So please feel free to browse the code and contribute back to the project.

## Credit
This project and the first HMR implementation was originally written by [@capaj](https://github.com/capaj), and none of this would have been possible without [Guy Bedford](https://github.com/guybedford).
